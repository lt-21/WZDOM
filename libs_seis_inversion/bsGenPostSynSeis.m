%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% trueModel: impedance model, 1D or 2D, each column vector represents a
% trace
%
% waveletFreq: the domain frequency of Ricker wavelet
%
% dt: sampling interval (ms)
%
% SNR: the signal to noise ratio, for adding noise on synthetic data
%
% isReadMode: if it is true, the data will be read from modelSavePath
%
% modelSavePath: the path to save the generated data
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% OUTPUT
% 
% poststackFreeNoise: noise-free synthetic seismic data
%
% poststackNoise: noise added seismic data
%
% poststackBandPassNoise: band limited noise added seismic data
% 
% G: forward operator made by wavelet
