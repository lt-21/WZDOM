Numerical Tour of Signal Processing
Copyright (c) 2009 Gabriel Peyre

This toolbox includes the Matlab function to generate a HTML file of a Numerical Tour.
It includes the following files
* perform_publishing.m: the main function, that generate the HTML file.
* signal_intro.m: a sample tour.
* readme: this file.
* perform_toolbox_zipping.m: a helper to zip all toolboxes (not needed).
* perform_scilab_conversion.m: a help function to convert a Matlab file in a Scilab file.

Each tour should be written as a separate Matlab .m file.
The file 'signal_intro' is an example of such a file.
To generat the HTML file, simply use 

perform_publishing('signal_intro');

The HTML file is generated in the directory html/signal_intro/.
The solution to the exercises are generate in the directory private-svg/signal_intro/.
